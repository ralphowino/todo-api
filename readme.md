#Building a Restful API using Laravel
This is an advanced version of the simple todo list example api common with most tutorials.

## Status
The step by step tutorial is still work in progress. For now you can read through the phpdocs, browse through the files, make calls using swagger or postman (whichever you are comfortable with) and most importantly build your own api.

##Version Used
I have used an intersection between laravel 5 and 4.2. This is partly because Laravel 5, while still unstable, is bound to come in in the next few weeks (January to be exact). So let's make our app using the latest stable api while ensuring we have a smooth transition to laravel 5.

##Components Used
The list of components used in this tutorial will keep changing with time as new packages emerge. The current components used include:

- [**Dingo/api**](https://github.com/dingo/api): An awesome package by @jasonclewis that  scaffold a lot of the api features required to make a great api
- [**Lucadegasperi/oauth2-server-laravel**](https://github.com/lucadegasperi/oauth2-server-laravel): A Laravel wrapper for the phpleague/oauth-server package. Makes integrating OAuth 2.0 fast and easy
